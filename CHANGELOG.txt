# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking Change**: Transport dependencies are now optional peer dependencies
  - `@grpc/grpc-js`, `@grpc/proto-loader`, `ioredis`, and `ws` are no longer automatically installed
  - Install only the transport packages you need (see README for details)
  - HTTP transport works out-of-the-box with no additional dependencies
  - Improved error messages guide users to install missing dependencies when needed
  - Significantly reduced installation size for users who don't need all transports

### Technical Details
- Refactored transport adapters to use dynamic imports (lazy loading)
- Dependencies are loaded only when the corresponding transport is actually used
- Added helpful error messages when transport dependencies are missing
